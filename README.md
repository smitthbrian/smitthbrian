## 🔹 Professional Statement

As a systems engineer, I am dedicated to fortifying enterprise infrastructure against evolving threats through a blend of technical expertise and strategic thinking. My experience as a Junior Systems Engineer at Ally Financial has provided a strong foundation in enterprise vulnerability remediation and maintaining infrastructure reliability.

My academic background, a BSBA in Computer Information Systems with a Cybersecurity concentration, is reinforced by hands-on project experience in areas such as scripting, process automation and documentation, and security incident response. My proficiency extends to key GRC functions, leveraging tools like Splunk for analysis and Confluence for documentation to ensure **clear communication and compliance standards** are met. This experience is built upon a foundation of commitment and leadership -- the same skills exhibited by my Eagle Scout award. 

Rather than viewing security as a one-time implementation, I approach it as a discipline of **continuous improvement**, ensuring the maturation of existing projects over the constant launch of new initiatives. My AWS Solutions Architect and Cloud Practitioner certifications further validate my cloud expertise. I thrive in collaborative environments focused on creating efficient and secure technological solutions that align with business objectives.
