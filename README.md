# Brian Smith's IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üõ°Ô∏è  

I'm passionate about integrating AI into cybersecurity solutions and improving the ethical and efficient use of these systems. My projects focus on areas such as IT auditing, threat detection, ethical hacking, and governance. Feel free to explore my repositories and see how I apply hands-on solutions to modern security challenges.  

## üî• Ethical Hacking and Offensive Security  

- **[Password Cracking: Windows & Kali Attack Simulation](https://github.com/smitthbrian/Password-Cracking)**  
  A hands-on ethical hacking project demonstrating password cracking techniques using Windows & Kali VMs, Hashcat, NTLM hashing, and Wireshark packet analysis. This project bridges technical concepts with non-technical explanations for better cybersecurity awareness.  

- **[SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/smitthbrian/SQL-Injection-Vulnerabilities)**  
  A practical demonstration of SQL injection attacks, their risks, and effective mitigation techniques. This project walks through exploiting SQL vulnerabilities using Windows Server, MariaDB, and ASPX applications while also showcasing secure coding practices.  

- **[Liber8tion Password Cracking Simulation](https://github.com/smitthbrian/Network-Traffic-Analysis)**  
  Cracking password dumps using Hashcat and the rockyou wordlist to simulate real-world hacker scenarios.  

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations and Threat Analysis  

- **[Wireshark Incident Report Simulation](https://github.com/smitthbrian/Wireshark-Incident-Report-)**  
  A detailed report analyzing network incidents using Wireshark to identify anomalies and threats.  

- **[Web Access Log Analysis for Superior Schedules](https://github.com/smitthbrian/Password-Audit-Simulation)**  
  Auditing web access logs to identify probing attempts and indicators of compromise like AndroxGh0st and SYSTEMBC.  

## üö® Risk Management and Defensive Security  

- **[Ransomware and Least Privilege Project](https://github.com/smitthbrian/Ransomware-and-Least-Privilege-Project)**  
  A project focused on implementing the principle of least privilege to prevent ransomware attacks, including security measures and risk mitigation strategies.  

- **[Incident Disclosure Mock Report for Flair Airlines](https://github.com/smitthbrian/Incident-Disclosure-Mock-Report)**  
  A mock cybersecurity incident report summarizing federal laws and disclosure requirements for a simulated board meeting.  

- **[Web Application Vulnerabilities Simulation](https://github.com/smitthbrian/XSS-CSRF-Session-Hijacking-and-Malicious-File-Uploads/tree/main)**  
  A multi-vector security walkthrough of XSS, CSRF, session hijacking, and malicious file upload attacks. Includes real-world examples using vulnerable .aspx pages, session cloning, cookie theft, and mitigation strategies like WAFs, input validation, and secure file handling.

## üìä Data and Database Security  

- **[Database Management Simulation](https://github.com/smitthbrian/Database-Management---Cumulative-MySQL-Code)**  
  A comprehensive project on creating and managing databases, leveraging SQL for business insights.
