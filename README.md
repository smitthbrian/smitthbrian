## 🔹 About Me

Hey, I’m **Brian Smith** — a recent CIS graduate and current Cybersecurity Intern at InfusionPoints, LLC, where I’m rotating through departments like advisory, engineering, and the Security Operations Center (SOC). My work bridges offensive and defensive security, IT auditing, and compliance-driven risk management.

Recently, I earned the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)** certification, which deepened my expertise in cloud architecture and security. To prepare for that exam, I earned the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** certification, setting a good baseline for the SAA-C03 exam.

I'm especially passionate about integrating **AI into cybersecurity systems**, designing secure enterprise networks, and communicating complex findings in business-aligned terms. I strongly believe in the power of _continuous learning_ — staying informed, adaptable, and always one step ahead of evolving threats.
