## 🔹 Professional Statement

I am a systems engineer working at the intersection of cybersecurity, information governance, and operational reliability in regulated enterprise environments. In my current role as a Junior Systems Engineer on the Connectivity Services Reliability Engineering (CSRE) team at Ally Financial, I support privileged activity monitoring (PAM), controlled evidence handling, and audit readiness across large-scale network infrastructure.

Much of my work centers on managing sensitive and classified operational information, including system-generated records, audit evidence packages, and documentation that must meet strict regulatory and procedural requirements. I regularly collaborate with GRC, audit, security, and engineering teams to ensure information is accurate, traceable, and defensible, using systems of record such as ServiceNow, Archer, SharePoint, Confluence, and Jira.

My academic background includes a BSBA in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity, complemented by hands-on experience in automation, documentation, and compliance-driven workflows. I am particularly interested in information lifecycle management, document control, and process improvement, with a focus on making complex systems measurable, repeatable, and auditable rather than one-off or ad hoc.

Outside of technical work, I bring a strong foundation in leadership and accountability, developed through roles such as Eagle Scout and prior experience at Philmont Scout Ranch in northern New Mexico. I approach security and information management as disciplines of continuous improvement, balancing efficiency with rigor in environments where trust and precision matter.
